I re-designed back in 2012 and old amplifier design published in one of the local magazines for radio amateurs in 1992. The goal was to adapt it to modern (back in 2012) semiconductors and redesign the PCB for DIY audio community in the country.
There is not too much description: I couldnt find the original text. 
 I, with a few other guys managed to sell a few hundreds pcs of the kit and also I made probably another 100 pcs at home by myself. It works as a charm after first powering. Some guys used it as headphone amplifier. 

Some parameters:
Power transistors : TOSHIBA 2SC5200/2SA1943
 Exciters : 2SA1837/2CS4792 or 2SA1930/2SC5171
Pre-amplifier : BD139/140 
Differential stage : BC550/560
Power supply : 2x30V DC 4R 
Output power : 56W
Minimum load impedance : 4R Input sensitivity 
: approx. 1 -1.3V@56W SR waveform speed : 52V/us
Fuses : F2,5A 
Dimension - 130x115 mm
Quiescent current on fuses approx. 120mA (on emitter resistors approx. 13-26mV)
